# Monthly Energy Used Forecasting for YVR airport 

Budget planning at YVR requires forecasting the cost of energy to operate the airport. An accurate forecast could help the YVR representatives negotiate more favourable contracts with energy suppliers. The main goal of this project is to develop a model to forecast monthly energy use for the Vancouver International Airport (YVR).  

We developed a range of ETS and ARIMA forecasting models, compared their performance to identify the optimal forecasting model to support budget planning of YVR airport's energy usage.

Project in collaboration with Ken Yung.
